The interaction should feel logical, comfortable, and realistic â€“ for example, the person might be holding, using, wearing, or looking at the product. Ensure the lighting, perspective, and proportions of both images are harmonized so they appear in the same scene. Blend seamlessly with no visible artifacts from the source images. Maintain high resolution and an advertising-ready, polished look.",
